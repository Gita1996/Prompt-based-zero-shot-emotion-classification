fear,This issue worried me rather than saddening me. In mid September I went to Guanggho alone. I was looking for an accomodation in the evening and after having walked or miles I still could not find anything. What could I do? I was not worried about sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems. I finally found a place to sleep at o'clock. ,fear,"[0.3887903392314911, 0.28031712770462036, 0.9855265617370605, 0.6933229565620422, 0.12231412529945374, 0.5527017116546631, 0.1653173416852951]",anxiety,0.9855265617370605
anger,"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had melody but had no content. We lived together so when he played the recorder I was forced to listen to them. I could not tell him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right to disturb the freedom of others. So I would find a pretext to leave the room and go somewhere else.

shame,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her grand-daughter. The grand-daughter asked me some questions in mathematics so I taught her. However she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy. The second year it was the same. When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be employed as their daghters tutor. They told me that at university there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they made a time-table for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week. They did not respect me and anyway I had another child to teach. ,sadness,"[0.9805770516395569, 0.9382880926132202, 0.8185486197471619, 0.8198558688163757, 0.02056080475449562, 0.989276647567749, 0.9687064290046692]",unhappy,0.989276647567749
