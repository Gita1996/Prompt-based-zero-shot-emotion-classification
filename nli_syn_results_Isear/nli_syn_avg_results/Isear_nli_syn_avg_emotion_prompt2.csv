shame,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her grand-daughter. The grand-daughter asked me some questions in mathematics so I taught her. However she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy. The second year it was the same. When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be employed as their daghters tutor. They told me that at university there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they made a time-table for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week. They did not respect me and anyway I had another child to teach. ,anger,"[0.5214091315865517, 0.4505353346467018, 0.11799781086544196, 0.40886222819487256, 0.019557468437900145, 0.44993386293450993, 0.3067087804277738]",0.5214091315865517
