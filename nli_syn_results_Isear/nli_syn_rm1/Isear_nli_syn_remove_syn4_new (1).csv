anger,"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had melody but had no content. We lived together so when he played the recorder I was forced to listen to them. I could not tell him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right to disturb the freedom of others. So I would find a pretext to leave the room and go somewhere else.

shame,"Last Summer I went camping with some C. U students. As I was working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had joined us the first night). Next morning, o'clock, a female classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up. I was not fully conscious and I said something which I should not have. I realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide. Later I said sorry to her and the matter came to an end.

shame,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her grand-daughter. The grand-daughter asked me some questions in mathematics so I taught her. However she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy. The second year it was the same. When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be employed as their daghters tutor. They told me that at university there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they made a time-table for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week. They did not respect me and anyway I had another child to teach. ,sadness,"[0.9295784831047058, 0.8340474963188171, 0.2122890055179596, 0.38519319891929626, 0.0021704977843910456, 0.9852524399757385, 0.08019274473190308]"
